  "The root, 'halt', has the meaning of to hold or to keep. Not only are the German 'halt' and English 'hold' very similar to each other, they also share combine prefixes to form related words in very similar ways. Take 'abhalten', 'to hold off', or 'aushalten', 'to hold out', or 'zur√ºckhalten', 'to hold back'. Other words might not seem so closely related until it is observed that the root 'tain' came in English from French and ultimately from Latin, where it also has the meaning 'hold.' So 'aufhalten' is 'to detain', 'behalten' means 'to retain' and 'enthalten' means to 'abstain'.
